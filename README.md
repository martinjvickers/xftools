# XFTOOLS

Tools written by Martin Vickers for use within the Xiaoqi Feng lab at the John Innes Centre.

## Static Binary

For ease of use I have created static binaries which can be downloaded, extracted and run on Linux machines. These have been tested on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, 14.04 LTS and 16.04 LTS as well as CentOS 6/7 and Scientific Linux 6/7. If these don't work on your machine you may need to compile from source. As I don't have a OSX machine I've not been able to test or create install instructions for OSX.



## Compile from source
